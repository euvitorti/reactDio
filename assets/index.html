    <h1>React</h1>
    <p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It
        allows developers to create reusable UI components, which can manage their own state and be composed together to
        build complex user interfaces.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of React:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Component-Based: React applications are built using components, which are self-contained units that
            encapsulate their own logic, rendering, and styles.</li>
        <li>JSX Syntax: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows HTML-like code to be written within JavaScript.
            This makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of the UI.</li>
        <li>Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components. When the state of an
            object changes, React updates the virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version, and only updates the
            actual DOM where changes have occurred.</li>
        <li>State Management: React components can manage their own state, allowing for dynamic and interactive user
            interfaces. State can be local to a component or shared across multiple components using state management
            libraries like Redux or Context API.</li>
        <li>Lifecycle Methods: React components have lifecycle methods that allow developers to execute code at specific
            points in a component's lifecycle, such as when a component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.</li>
        <li>Hooks: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that let developers use state and other React features
            in functional components, making it easier to manage component logic without using classes.</li>
        <li>Declarative: React encourages a declarative programming style, where developers describe what the UI should
            look like for a given state, and React takes care of updating the UI to match that state.</li>
    </ul>
